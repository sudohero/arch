# arch
My arch configurations and dotfiles. Some are out of place, but see the notes below.

I switched from i3 to dwm so i3 will not be updated further.

I use arch btw...

## gruvbox_custom.py
Copy this file to '/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/powerline_shell/themes' (or which ever python version you have). Also be sure you have the '.powerline-shell.json' file in your home directory.

The gruvbox_dark.txt was just a file so I could keep an easy note of the hex codes for the colors I wanted. I have since changed the codes which can be found in 'st/config.h'
